# My LLM coding workflow going into 2026

**January 4, 2026**

AI coding assistants became game-changers in 2025, but harnessing them
effectively takes skill and structure. These tools dramatically increased what
LLMs can do for real-world coding, and many developers (myself included)
embraced them. At Anthropic, for example, engineers adopted Claude Code so
heavily that
[today](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineering-with-llms-in-2025#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)
~90% of the code for Claude Code is written by Claude Code itself. Yet, using
LLMs for programming is not a push-button magic experience - it’s “difficult and
unintuitive” and getting great results requires learning new patterns.
[Critical thinking](https://addyo.substack.com/p/critical-thinking-during-the-age)
remains key. Over a year of projects, I’ve converged on a workflow similar to
what many experienced devs are discovering: treat the LLM as a powerful pair
programmer that requires clear direction, context and oversight rather than
autonomous judgment. In this article, I’ll share how I plan, code, and
collaborate with AI going into 2026, distilling tips and best practices from my
experience and the community’s collective learning. It’s a more disciplined
“AI-assisted engineering” approach - leveraging AI aggressively while staying
proudly accountable for the software produced. If you’re interested in more on
my workflow, see “The AI-Native Software Engineer”, otherwise let’s dive
straight into some of the lessons I learned.

## Start with a clear plan (specs before code)

Don’t just throw wishes at the LLM - begin by defining the problem and planning
a solution. One common mistake is diving straight into code generation with a
vague prompt. In my workflow, and in many others’, the first step is
brainstorming a detailed specification with the AI, then outlining a
step-by-step plan, before writing any actual code. For a new project, I’ll
describe the idea and ask the LLM to iteratively ask me questions until we’ve
fleshed out requirements and edge cases. By the end, we compile this into a
comprehensive spec.md - containing requirements, architecture decisions, data
models, and even a testing strategy. This spec forms the foundation for
development. Next, I feed the spec into a reasoning-capable model and prompt it
to generate a project plan: break the implementation into logical, bite-sized
tasks or milestones. The AI essentially helps me do a mini “design doc” or
project plan. I often iterate on this plan - editing and asking the AI to
critique or refine it - until it’s coherent and complete. Only then do I proceed
to coding. This upfront investment might feel slow, but it pays off enormously.
As Les Orchard
[put it](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/#:~:text=Accidental%20waterfall%20),
it’s like doing a “waterfall in 15 minutes” - a rapid structured planning phase
that makes the subsequent coding much smoother. Having a clear spec and plan
means when we unleash the codegen, both the human and the LLM know exactly what
we’re building and why. In short, planning first forces you and the AI onto the
same page and prevents wasted cycles. It’s a step many people are tempted to
skip, but experienced LLM developers now treat a robust spec/plan as the
cornerstone of the workflow.

## Break work into small, iterative chunks

Scope management is everything - feed the LLM manageable tasks, not the whole
codebase at once. A crucial lesson I’ve learned is to avoid asking the AI for
large, monolithic outputs. Instead, we break the project into iterative steps or
tickets and tackle them
[one by one](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/#:~:text=please%20write%20out%20this%20plan%2C,in%20full%20detail%2C%20into%20docs%2Fplans).
This mirrors good software engineering practice, but it’s even more important
with AI in the loop. LLMs do best when given focused prompts: implement one
function, fix one bug, add one feature at a time. For example, after planning, I
will prompt the codegen model: “Okay, let’s implement Step 1 from the plan”. We
code that, test it, then move to Step 2, and so on. Each chunk is small enough
that the AI can handle it within context and you can understand the code it
produces. This approach guards against the model going off the rails. If you ask
for too much in one go, it’s likely to get confused or produce a “jumbled mess”
that’s hard to untangle. Developers
[report](https://albertofortin.com/writing/coding-with-ai#:~:text=No%20consistency%2C%20no%20overarching%20plan,the%20other%209%20were%20doing)
that when they tried to have an LLM generate huge swaths of an app, they ended
up with inconsistency and duplication - “like 10 devs worked on it without
talking to each other,” one said. I’ve felt that pain; the fix is to stop, back
up, and split the problem into smaller pieces. Each iteration, we carry forward
the context of what’s been built and incrementally add to it. This also fits
nicely with a test-driven development (TDD) approach - we can write or generate
tests for each piece as we go (more on testing soon). Several coding-agent tools
now explicitly support this chunked workflow. For instance, I often generate a
structured “prompt plan” file that contains a sequence of prompts for each task,
so that tools like Cursor can execute them one by one. The key point is to avoid
huge leaps. By iterating in small loops, we greatly reduce the chance of
catastrophic errors and we can course-correct quickly. LLMs excel at quick,
contained tasks - use that to your advantage.

## Provide extensive context and guidance

LLMs are only as good as the context you provide - show them the relevant code,
docs, and constraints. When working on a codebase, I make sure to feed the AI
all the information it needs to perform well. That includes the code it should
modify or refer to, the project’s technical constraints, and any known pitfalls
or preferred approaches. Modern tools help with this: for example, Anthropic’s
Claude can import an entire GitHub repo into its context in “Projects” mode, and
IDE assistants like Cursor or Copilot auto-include open files in the prompt. But
I often go further - I will either use an MCP like
[Context7](https://context7.com/) or manually copy important pieces of the
codebase or API docs into the conversation if I suspect the model doesn’t have
them. Expert LLM users emphasize this “context packing” step. For example, doing
a “brain dump” of everything the model should know before coding, including:
high-level goals and invariants, examples of good solutions, and warnings about
approaches to avoid. If I’m asking an AI to implement a tricky solution, I might
tell it which naive solutions are too slow, or provide a reference
implementation from elsewhere. If I’m using a niche library or a brand-new API,
I’ll paste in the official docs or README so the AI isn’t flying blind. All of
this upfront context dramatically improves the quality of its output, because
the model isn’t guessing - it has the facts and constraints in front of it.
There are now utilities to automate context packaging. I’ve experimented with
tools like [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/) or
[repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt), which essentially
“dump” the relevant parts of your codebase into a text file for the LLM to read.
These can be a lifesaver when dealing with a large project - you generate an
output.txt bundle of key source files and let the model ingest that. The
principle is: don’t make the AI operate on partial information. If a bug fix
requires understanding four different modules, show it those four modules. Yes,
we must watch token limits, but current frontier models have pretty huge context
windows (tens of thousands of tokens). Use them wisely. I often selectively
include just the portions of code relevant to the task at hand, and explicitly
tell the AI to not focus on out of scope items. I think
[Claude Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) have potential because
they turn what used to be fragile repeated prompting into something durable and
reusable by packaging instructions, scripts, and domain specific expertise into
modular capabilities that tools can automatically apply when a request matches
the Skill. This means you get more reliable and context aware results than a
generic prompt ever could and you move away from one off interactions toward
workflows that encode repeatable procedures and team knowledge for tasks in a
consistent way. A number of community-curated
[Skills collections](https://www.x-cmd.com/skill/) exist, but one of my favorite
examples is the
[frontend-design](https://x.com/trq212/status/1989061937590837678) skill which
can “end” the purple design aesthetic prevalent in LLM generated UIs. Until more
tools support Skills officially,
[workarounds](https://github.com/intellectronica/skillz) exist. Finally, guide
the AI with comments and rules inside the prompt. I might precede a code snippet
with: “Here is the current implementation of X. We need to extend it to do Y,
but be careful not to break Z.” These little hints go a long way. LLMs are
literalists - they’ll follow instructions, so give them detailed, contextual
instructions. By proactively providing context and guidance, we minimize
hallucinations and off-base suggestions and get code that fits our project’s
needs.

## Choose the right model (and use multiple when needed)

Not all coding LLMs are equal - pick your tool with intention, and don’t be
afraid to swap models mid-stream. In 2025 we’ve been spoiled with a variety of
capable code-focused LLMs. Part of my workflow is choosing the model or service
best suited to each task. Sometimes it can be valuable to even try two or more
LLMs in parallel to cross-check how they might approach the same problem
differently. Each model has its own “personality”. The key is: if one model gets
stuck or gives mediocre outputs, try another. I’ve literally copied the same
prompt from one chat into another service to see if it can handle it better.
This
“[model musical chairs](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/06/07/semi-automatic-coding/#:~:text=I%20bounced%20between%20Claude%20Sonnet,Each%20had%20its%20own%20personality)”
can rescue you when you hit a model’s blind spot. Also, make sure you’re using
the best version available. If you can, use the newest “pro” tier models -
because quality matters. And yes, it often means paying for access, but the
productivity gains can justify it. Ultimately, pick the AI pair programmer whose
“vibe” meshes with you. I know folks who prefer one model simply because they
like how its responses feel. That’s valid - when you’re essentially in a
constant dialogue with an AI, the UX and tone make a difference. Personally I
gravitate towards Gemini for a lot of coding work these days because the
interaction feels more natural and it often understands my requests on the first
try. But I will not hesitate to switch to another model if needed; sometimes a
second opinion helps the solution emerge. In summary: use the best tool for the
job, and remember you have an arsenal of AIs at your disposal.

## Leverage AI coding across the lifecycle

Supercharge your workflow with coding-specific AI help across the SDLC. On the
command-line, new AI agents emerged. Claude Code, OpenAI’s Codex CLI and
Google’s Gemini CLI are CLI tools where you can chat with them directly in your
project directory - they can read files, run tests, and even multi-step fix
issues. I’ve used Google’s Jules and GitHub’s Copilot Agent as well - these are
asynchronous coding agents that actually clone your repo into a cloud VM and
work on tasks in the background (writing tests, fixing bugs, then opening a PR
for you). It’s a bit eerie to witness: you issue a command like “refactor the
payment module for X” and a little while later you get a pull request with code
changes and passing tests. We are truly living in the future. You can read more
about this in
[conductors to orchestrators](https://addyo.substack.com/p/conductors-to-orchestrators-the-future).
That said, these tools are not infallible, and you must understand their limits.
They accelerate the mechanical parts of coding - generating boilerplate,
applying repetitive changes, running tests automatically - but they still
benefit greatly from your guidance. For instance, when I use an agent like
Claude or Copilot to implement something, I often supply it with the plan or
to-do list from earlier steps so it knows the exact sequence of tasks. If the
agent supports it, I’ll load up my spec.md or plan.md in the context before
telling it to execute. This keeps it on track. We’re not at the stage of letting
an AI agent code an entire feature unattended and expecting perfect results.
Instead, I use these tools in a supervised way: I’ll let them generate and even
run code, but I keep an eye on each step, ready to step in when something looks
off. There are also orchestration tools like Conductor that let you run multiple
agents in parallel on different tasks (essentially a way to scale up AI help) -
some engineers are experimenting with running 3-4 agents at once on separate
features. I’ve dabbled in this “massively parallel” approach; it’s surprisingly
effective at getting a lot done quickly, but it’s also mentally taxing to
monitor multiple AI threads! For most cases, I stick to one main agent at a time
and maybe a secondary one for reviews (discussed below). Just remember these are
power tools - you still control the trigger and guide the outcome.

## Keep a human in the loop - verify, test, and review everything

AI will happily produce plausible-looking code, but you are responsible for
quality - always review and test thoroughly. One of my cardinal rules is never
to blindly trust an LLM’s output. As Simon Willison aptly
[says](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20use%20them%20to%20augment,on%20tedious%20tasks%20without%20complaint),
think of an LLM pair programmer as “over-confident and prone to mistakes”. It
writes code with complete conviction - including bugs or nonsense - and won’t
tell you something is wrong unless you catch it. So I treat every AI-generated
snippet as if it came from a junior developer: I read through the code, run it,
and test it as needed. You absolutely have to test what it writes - run those
unit tests, or manually exercise the feature, to ensure it does what it claims.
Read more about this in
[vibe coding is not an excuse for low-quality work](https://addyo.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-is-not-an-excuse-for).
In fact, I weave testing into the workflow itself. My earlier planning stage
often includes generating a list of tests or a testing plan for each step. If
I’m using a tool like Claude Code, I’ll instruct it to run the test suite after
implementing a task, and have it debug failures if any occur. This kind of tight
feedback loop (write code → run tests → fix) is something AI excels at as long
as the tests exist. It’s no surprise that those who get the most out of coding
agents tend to be those with strong testing practices. An agent like Claude can
“fly” through a project with a good test suite as safety net. Without tests, the
agent might blithely assume everything is fine (“sure, all good!”) when in
reality it’s broken several things. So, invest in tests - it amplifies the AI’s
usefulness and confidence in the result. Even beyond automated tests, do code
reviews - both manual and AI-assisted. I routinely pause and review the code
that’s been generated so far, line by line. Sometimes I’ll spawn a second AI
session (or a different model) and ask it to critique or review code produced by
the first. For example, I might have Claude write the code and then ask Gemini,
“Can you review this function for any errors or improvements?” This can catch
subtle issues. The key is to not skip the review just because an AI wrote the
code. If anything, AI-written code needs extra scrutiny, because it can
sometimes be superficially convincing while hiding flaws that a human might not
immediately notice. I also use
[Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/chromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/),
built with my last team, for my debugging and quality loop to bridge the gap
between static code analysis and live browser execution. It “gives your agent
eyes”. It lets me grant my AI tools direct access to see what the browser can,
inspect the DOM, get rich performance traces, console logs or network traces.
This integration eliminates the friction of manual context switching, allowing
for automated UI testing directly through the LLM. It means bugs can be
diagnosed and fixed with high precision based on actual runtime data. The dire
consequences of skipping human oversight have been documented. One developer who
leaned heavily on AI generation for a rush project
[described](https://albertofortin.com/writing/coding-with-ai#:~:text=No%20consistency%2C%20no%20overarching%20plan,the%20other%209%20were%20doing)
the result as an inconsistent mess - duplicate logic, mismatched method names,
no coherent architecture. He realized he’d been “building, building, building”
without stepping back to really see what the AI had woven together. The fix was
a painful refactor and a vow to never let things get that far out of hand again.
I’ve taken that to heart. No matter how much AI I use, I remain the accountable
engineer. In practical terms, that means I only merge or ship code after I’ve
understood it. If the AI generates something convoluted, I’ll ask it to add
comments explaining it, or I’ll rewrite it in simpler terms. If something
doesn’t feel right, I dig in - just as I would if a human colleague contributed
code that raised red flags. It’s all about mindset: the LLM is an assistant, not
an autonomously reliable coder. I am the senior dev; the LLM is there to
accelerate me, not replace my judgment. Maintaining this stance not only results
in better code, it also protects your own growth as a developer. (I’ve heard
some express concern that relying too much on AI might dull their skills - I
think as long as you stay in the loop, actively reviewing and understanding
everything, you’re still sharpening your instincts, just at a higher velocity.)
In short: stay alert, test often, review always. It’s still your codebase at the
end of the day.

## Commit often and use version control as a safety net. Never commit code you can’t explain.

Frequent commits are your save points - they let you undo AI missteps and
understand changes. When working with an AI that can generate a lot of code
quickly, it’s easy for things to veer off course. I mitigate this by adopting
ultra-granular version control habits. I commit early and often, even more than
I would in normal hand-coding. After each small task or each successful
automated edit, I’ll make a git commit with a clear message. This way, if the
AI’s next suggestion introduces a bug or a messy change, I have a recent
checkpoint to revert to (or cherry-pick from) without losing hours of work. One
practitioner likened it to treating commits as “save points in a game” - if an
LLM session goes sideways, you can always roll back to the last stable commit.
I’ve found that advice incredibly useful. It’s much less stressful to experiment
with a bold AI refactor when you know you can undo it with a git reset if
needed. Proper version control also helps when collaborating with the AI. Since
I can’t rely on the AI to remember everything it’s done (context window
limitations, etc.), the git history becomes a valuable log. I often scan my
recent commits to brief the AI (or myself) on what changed. In fact, LLMs
themselves can leverage your commit history if you provide it - I’ve pasted git
diffs or commit logs into the prompt so the AI knows what code is new or what
the previous state was. Amusingly, LLMs are really good at parsing diffs and
using tools like git bisect to find where a bug was introduced. They have
infinite patience to traverse commit histories, which can augment your
debugging. But this only works if you have a tidy commit history to begin with.
Another benefit: small commits with good messages essentially document the
development process, which helps when doing code review (AI or human). If an AI
agent made five changes in one go and something broke, having those changes in
separate commits makes it easier to pinpoint which commit caused the issue. If
everything is in one giant commit titled “AI changes”, good luck! So I
discipline myself: finish task, run tests, commit. This also meshes well with
the earlier tip about breaking work into small chunks - each chunk ends up as
its own commit or PR. Finally, don’t be afraid to use branches or worktrees to
isolate AI experiments. One advanced workflow I’ve adopted (inspired by folks
like Jesse Vincent) is to spin up a fresh git worktree for a new feature or
sub-project. This lets me run multiple AI coding sessions in parallel on the
same repo without them interfering, and I can later merge the changes. It’s a
bit like having each AI task in its own sandbox branch. If one experiment fails,
I throw away that worktree and nothing is lost in main. If it succeeds, I merge
it in. This approach has been crucial when I’m, say, letting an AI implement
Feature A while I (or another AI) work on Feature B simultaneously. Version
control is what makes this coordination possible. In short: commit often,
organize your work with branches, and embrace git as the control mechanism to
keep AI-generated changes manageable and reversible.

## Customize the AI’s behavior with rules and examples

Steer your AI assistant by providing style guides, examples, and even “rules
files” - a little upfront tuning yields much better outputs. One thing I learned
is that you don’t have to accept the AI’s default style or approach - you can
influence it heavily by giving it guidelines. For instance, I have a CLAUDE.md
file that I update periodically, which contains process rules and preferences
for Claude (Anthropic’s model) to follow (and similarly a GEMINI.md when using
Gemini CLI). This includes things like “write code in our project’s style,
follow our lint rules, don’t use certain functions, prefer functional style over
OOP,” etc. When I start a session, I feed this file to Claude to align it with
our conventions. It’s surprising how well this works to keep the model “on
track” as Jesse Vincent
[noted](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/#:~:text=I%27m%20still%20primarily%20using%20Claude,Code) -
it reduces the tendency of the AI to go off-script or introduce patterns we
don’t want. Even without a fancy rules file, you can set the tone with custom
instructions or system prompts. GitHub Copilot and Cursor both introduced
features to let you configure the AI’s behavior
[globally](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/02/02/How-I-Use-AI-Early-2025/#:~:text=stuck,my%20company%E2%80%99s%20%2F%20team%E2%80%99s%20codebase)
for your project. I’ve taken advantage of that by writing a short paragraph
about our coding style, e.g. “Use 4 spaces indent, avoid arrow functions in
React, prefer descriptive variable names, code should pass ESLint.” With those
instructions in place, the AI’s suggestions adhere much more closely to what a
human teammate might write. Ben Congdon
[mentioned](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/02/02/How-I-Use-AI-Early-2025/#:~:text=roughly%20on%20par,get%20past%20a%20logical%20impasse)
how shocked he was that few people use Copilot’s custom instructions, given how
effective they are - he could guide the AI to output code matching his team’s
idioms by providing some examples and preferences upfront. I echo that: take the
time to teach the AI your expectations. Another powerful technique is providing
in-line examples of the output format or approach you want. If I want the AI to
write a function in a very specific way, I might first show it a similar
function already in the codebase: “Here’s how we implemented X, use a similar
approach for Y.” If I want a certain commenting style, I might write a comment
myself and ask the AI to continue in that style. Essentially, prime the model
with the pattern to follow. LLMs are great at mimicry - show them one or two
examples and they’ll continue in that vein. The community has also come up with
creative “rulesets” to tame LLM behavior. You might have heard of the
[“Big Daddy” rule](https://harper.blog/2025/04/17/an-llm-codegen-heros-journey/#:~:text=repository,it%20in%20a%20few%20steps)
or adding a “no hallucination/no deception” clause to prompts. These are
basically tricks to remind the AI to be truthful and not overly fabricate code
that doesn’t exist. For example, I sometimes prepend a prompt with: “If you are
unsure about something or the codebase context is missing, ask for clarification
rather than making up an answer.” This reduces hallucinations. Another rule I
use is: “Always explain your reasoning briefly in comments when fixing a bug.”
This way, when the AI generates a fix, it will also leave a comment like “//
Fixed: Changed X to Y to prevent Z (as per spec).” That’s super useful for later
review. In summary, don’t treat the AI as a black box - tune it. By configuring
system instructions, sharing project docs, or writing down explicit rules, you
turn the AI into a more specialized developer on your team. It’s akin to
onboarding a new hire: you’d give them the style guide and some starter tips,
right? Do the same for your AI pair programmer. The return on investment is
huge: you get outputs that need less tweaking and integrate more smoothly with
your codebase.

## Embrace testing and automation as force multipliers

Use your CI/CD, linters, and code review bots - AI will work best in an
environment that catches mistakes automatically. This is a corollary to staying
in the loop and providing context: a well-oiled development pipeline enhances AI
productivity. I ensure that any repository where I use heavy AI coding has a
robust continuous integration setup. That means automated tests run on every
commit or PR, code style checks (like ESLint, Prettier, etc.) are enforced, and
ideally a staging deployment is available for any new branch. Why? Because I can
let the AI trigger these and evaluate the results. For instance, if the AI opens
a pull request via a tool like Jules or GitHub Copilot Agent, our CI will run
tests and report failures. I can feed those failure logs back to the AI: “The
integration tests failed with XYZ, let’s debug this.” It turns bug-fixing into a
collaborative loop with quick feedback, which AIs handle quite well (they’ll
suggest a fix, we run CI again, and iterate). Automated code quality checks
(linters, type checkers) also guide the AI. I actually include linter output in
the prompt sometimes. If the AI writes code that doesn’t pass our linter, I’ll
copy the linter errors into the chat and say “please address these issues.” The
model then knows exactly what to do. It’s like having a strict teacher looking
over the AI’s shoulder. In my experience, once the AI is aware of a tool’s
output (like a failing test or a lint warning), it will try very hard to correct
it - after all, it “wants” to produce the right answer. This ties back to
providing context: give the AI the results of its actions in the environment
(test failures, etc.) and it will learn from them. AI coding agents themselves
are increasingly incorporating automation hooks. Some agents will refuse to say
a code task is “done” until all tests pass, which is exactly the diligence you
want. Code review bots (AI or otherwise) act as another filter - I treat their
feedback as additional prompts for improvement. For example, if CodeRabbit or
another reviewer comments “This function is doing X which is not ideal” I will
ask the AI, “Can you refactor based on this feedback?” By combining AI with
automation, you start to get a virtuous cycle. The AI writes code, the automated
tools catch issues, the AI fixes them, and so forth, with you overseeing the
high-level direction. It feels like having an extremely fast junior dev whose
work is instantly checked by a tireless QA engineer. But remember, you set up
that environment. If your project lacks tests or any automated checks, the AI’s
work may slip through with subtle bugs or poor quality until much later. So as
we head into 2026, one of my goals is to bolster the quality gates around AI
code contribution: more tests, more monitoring, perhaps even AI-on-AI code
reviews. It might sound paradoxical (AIs reviewing AIs), but I’ve seen it catch
things one model missed. Bottom line: an AI-friendly workflow is one with strong
automation - use those tools to keep the AI honest.

## Continuously learn and adapt (AI amplifies your skills)

Treat every AI coding session as a learning opportunity - the more you know, the
more the AI can help you, creating a virtuous cycle. One of the most exciting
aspects of using LLMs in development is how much I have learned in the process.
Rather than replacing my need to know things, AIs have actually exposed me to
new languages, frameworks, and techniques I might not have tried on my own. This
pattern holds generally: if you come to the table with solid software
engineering fundamentals, the AI will amplify your productivity multifold. If
you lack that foundation, the AI might just amplify confusion. Seasoned devs
have observed that LLMs “reward existing best practices” - things like writing
clear specs, having good tests, doing code reviews, etc., all become even more
powerful when an AI is involved. In my experience, the AI lets me operate at a
higher level of abstraction (focusing on design, interface, architecture) while
it churns out the boilerplate, but I need to have those high-level skills first.
As Simon Willison notes, almost everything that makes someone a senior engineer
(designing systems, managing complexity, knowing what to automate vs hand-code)
is what now yields the best outcomes with AI. So using AIs has actually pushed
me to up my engineering game - I’m more rigorous about planning and more
conscious of architecture, because I’m effectively “managing” a very fast but
somewhat naïve coder (the AI). For those worried that using AI might degrade
their abilities: I’d argue the opposite, if done right. By reviewing AI code,
I’ve been exposed to new idioms and solutions. By debugging AI mistakes, I’ve
deepened my understanding of the language and problem domain. I often ask the AI
to explain its code or the rationale behind a fix - kind of like constantly
interviewing a candidate about their code - and I pick up insights from its
answers. I also use AI as a research assistant: if I’m not sure about a library
or approach, I’ll ask it to enumerate options or compare trade-offs. It’s like
having an encyclopedic mentor on call. All of this has made me a more
knowledgeable programmer. The big picture is that AI tools amplify your
expertise. Going into 2026, I’m not afraid of them “taking my job” - I’m excited
that they free me from drudgery and allow me to spend more time on creative and
complex aspects of software engineering. But I’m also aware that for those
without a solid base, AI can lead to Dunning-Kruger on steroids (it may seem
like you built something great, until it falls apart). So my advice: continue
honing your craft, and use the AI to accelerate that process. Be intentional
about periodically coding without AI too, to keep your raw skills sharp. In the
end, the developer + AI duo is far more powerful than either alone, and the
developer half of that duo has to hold up their end.

## Conclusion

I’ve fully embraced AI in my development workflow - but in a considered,
expert-driven way. My approach is essentially “AI-augmented software
engineering” rather than AI-automated software engineering. I’ve learned: the
best results come when you apply classic software engineering discipline to your
AI collaborations. It turns out all our hard-earned practices - design before
coding, write tests, use version control, maintain standards - not only still
apply, but are even more important when an AI is writing half your code. I’m
excited for what’s next. The tools keep improving and my workflow will surely
evolve alongside them. Perhaps fully autonomous “AI dev interns” will tackle
more grunt work while we focus on higher-level tasks. Perhaps new paradigms of
debugging and code exploration will emerge. No matter what, I plan to stay in
the loop - guiding the AIs, learning from them, and amplifying my productivity
responsibly. The bottom line for me: AI coding assistants are incredible force
multipliers, but the human engineer remains the director of the show. I’m
excited to share I’ve released a new
[AI-assisted engineering book](https://beyond.addy.ie/) with O’Reilly. There are
a number of free tips on the book site in case interested.
